# 📘 TypeScript Bible – Course Exercises

This repository contains my personal solutions to the exercises and challenges from the **TypeScript Bible** course — a focused, in-depth guide to mastering the complete type system of TypeScript.

## 🚀 About the Course

Unlike many other TypeScript courses, TypeScript Bible goes beyond basic syntax and configuration. Instead, it teaches you how to truly understand and leverage the TypeScript type system through real-world challenges, hands-on exercises, and carefully structured lessons.

By the end of the course, you will:

- Develop a deep understanding of TypeScript’s powerful type system.
- Master advanced concepts like recursive types, conditional types, template literal types, and more.
- Feel confident solving complex type errors and building intelligent type-safe functions.
- Become the TypeScript go-to person on your team.

> This course is ideal for developers who already have a solid understanding of TypeScript and want to take their skills to the next level.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Type-level algorithms using TypeScript
- Recursive types and type-level loops
- Template Literal Types
- Union and Intersection Types
- Conditional Types
- Mapped Types
- Function Overloads
- Generic Constraints
- Real-world type patterns used in libraries and frameworks

## 🧱 Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have:

- At least 1 year of programming experience in any language
- A solid grasp of TypeScript basics

## 📂 Structure

The repository is organized by course sections:

```
.
├── section-01/
├── section-02/
├── section-03/
├── section-04/
├── ...
└── extras/
```

Each folder contains:

- `README.md`: Brief summary of concepts learned
- `.ts` files: Exercise solutions and challenge implementations

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/typescript-bible-exercises.git
   cd typescript-bible-exercises
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run TypeScript compiler or test the exercises:
   ```bash
   npx tsc
   ```

   Or use `ts-node` for quick testing:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node section-01/example.ts
   ```
